    "1. Modify the *publish_ml_pipeline.py* script to use the pipeline definition that you created in the previous exercises.\n",
    "1. Create a repository in Azure DevOps (create a Azure DevOps project first if you don't have one). *Note: you can also use Github if you connect your Github account to Azure DevOps.*\n",
    "1. Create a Service connection linking your Azure DevOps project to your Azure Subscription.\n",
    "1. Configure the build pipeline for your Azure Subscription by changing the required variables in azure-devops.yml (marked by <VAR_NAME>). \n",
    "1. Setup the pipeline using Azure DevOps by creating a new build pipeline.\n",
    "1. Run the build pipeline to see if it manages to publish/run the pipeline and deploy the new model."
